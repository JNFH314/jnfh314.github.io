I’ve been having a religious (spiritual? or perhaps both?) crisis of sorts lately. 

The universe is breathtaking, in all its laws and chaos and structure and entropy. Despite my claims that i’m atheist (I am very passionate about STEM (<a href="https://instagram.com/omjee.nnifer" target="_blank">Soup To Eat Mmmm</a>)), I really do believe that there may be a higher power. Some cute little all-powerful being probably created “life” for a class project that they’ve been working really hard on, and (literally) boom: gravity, planets, black holes, stars, and the concept of "everything" that we throw around so casually. Not only is there life within these celestial beings; these celestial beings are alive themselves within the universe. How else would such a majestic entity exist if it weren’t for a higher power?
