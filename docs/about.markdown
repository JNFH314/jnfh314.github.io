    <h1>A Quick Introduction</h1>

    <p>To whatever lucky traveler that has landed on this website, welcome! My name is Jennifer Huang. Depending on who you are, you may know me as an avid cat fan (with cat allergies, of course), a puzzle enthusiast (leave me a message if you ever want to do sudokus, crosswords, and wordles together), or an aspiring game developer.</p>

    <p>The favicon is a squirrel, by the way. My friends say I remind them of one. Perhaps it's the way I get startled easily. Or maybe it's because I'm from Texas, and that reminds them of Sandy from Spongebob. Who knows?</p>
