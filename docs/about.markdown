# A Quick Introduction

I'm just going to leave the above information alone for now. My name is Jennifer Huang. Depending on who you are, you may know me as an avid cat fan (with cat allergies, of course), a puzzle enthusiast (sudokus, crosswords, and wordles got me through quarantine :")), or an aspiring game developer (says every computer scientist who games).
